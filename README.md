NOTE: Only run this importer once you have already ran the MKL importer - there is duplication checking specifically designed to merge duplicate PP profiles into existing MKL profiles.

Instructions:

1. Add a file called config.txt to the root of the project
2. On the first line of the file, enter the connection string of the MKW Leaderboard Site database
3. Edit the ```contents``` variable on line 9 to point to the config.txt file
4. Edit the path on line 16 to point to the PP dump file on your machine
5. Run the script
